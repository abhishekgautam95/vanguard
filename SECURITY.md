# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability
If you discover a security issue, please do not open a public issue.

Instead, share details privately with the maintainer and include:
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation (if available)

## Scope
Security reports should focus on:
- Credential/secrets exposure
- Auth bypass
- Data exfiltration risks
- Unsafe dependency or execution paths

## Response
We aim to acknowledge valid reports promptly and patch critical issues as quickly as possible.
